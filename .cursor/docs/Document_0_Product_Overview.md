## Product Overview & Context (Document 0)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Find Me a Hot Lead** is a multi-tenant, API-first B2B SaaS marketplace that captures user-generated sales leads and connects them with qualified service providers through a **fair, transparent, and scalable Competition Level–based distribution system**.

The platform is designed to:

- Enable **end users** to submit a single request and receive multiple competitive quotes without repeating themselves.
- Enable **service providers** to pay for real sales opportunities—not clicks, impressions, or speculative marketing actions.
- Enable **platform operators** to manage, monetize, and scale lead distribution across multiple niches with full control, auditability, and extensibility.

The long-term objective is to build a **trusted lead distribution infrastructure** that can power any service-based market globally.

## 2. Mission Statement

**Our mission is to empower service providers of all sizes to compete and grow by removing the risk, complexity, and expertise traditionally required to generate sales leads.**

We do this by delivering qualified leads on a pay-for-results basis and providing the tools needed to manage and convert those leads—capabilities that have historically been available only to larger organizations with dedicated marketing teams, budgets, and specialized skills.

---

## 3. Vision Statement

**Our vision is to fundamentally change how businesses think about marketing and lead generation by replacing speculative advertising with transparent, outcome-based growth.**

As lead sources evolve across search, social, AI, and platforms yet to be invented, *Find Me a Hot Lead* becomes the constant: a trusted global infrastructure where service providers pay for real opportunities, compete fairly, and grow without being constrained by budget size, team size, or shifting marketing trends.

## 7. Key Differentiators
